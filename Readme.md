# LazBaseUtils

This Package aims at providing a set of useful functions, and types for FreePascal.

It is based on and extends RecUtils (https://github.com/Warfley/Recutils) in order to provide a consistent package.

While for RecUtils all the units are independent, this provides all the units as one package, allowing the units to use each other and provide their full potential in combination.
Also unlike RecUtils, this repository provides more than just record types, but also classes and functions.

Further explainations can be found in the Readme of the different directories in `src`. See the `examples` directory for examples on how to use the units provided by this package.
